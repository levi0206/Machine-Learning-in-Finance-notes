# [Machine Learning in Finance](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jteichma/index.php?content=teach_mlf2023) notes
This repo contains my notes of the lectures. The notes might be ipynb files or pdf files (written with GoodNotes), depending on which one is more convinient to present my thoughts. 

The meeting record is available in the [study group](https://sites.google.com/view/sntung/study-group?authuser=0) held by Prof. Tung.

Any suggestion is welcome: levihsu2002@gmail.com
